# Project Description

This project was created to assist a friend in their work at Russia's largest bank (now subject to sanctions), while also teaching my girlfriend and friend how to code. Initially deployed on Heroku for a few months, it is now running locally on my friend's machine. Although there have been a few minor modifications, the project has been running smoothly for over a year and has helped numerous individuals in their daily work.

The project consists of a simple QA chatbot that aids in resolving common issues by storing the questions and answers in a text file. It also has a basic registration system that assigns internal IDs to different users.

While I have considered rewriting the project to make it more scalable, structured, and reusable, I ultimately decided against it due to time constraints and the fact that the existing code, despite being messy, is functional and serves its purpose. Furthermore, the project stores data in a text file instead of a database, and Python is not my priority career-wise, but rather a hobby.

Regardless, I am publishing this project to mark the end of a chapter. If you are interested, feel free to contribute to the project by submitting a pull request or simply exploring it for fun.
